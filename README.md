# Lottery_App
A sample Flutter project.

This is an lottery app which I made to understand the concept of Stateful Widgets.

It has a lucky number '4' as an input and if the user gets it by tapping the refresh button, it'll say you've won the lottery otherwise you'll get another message. I've used the dart:math package to generate random number, where the max value is set to 6 out which it'll give a random number.

Here's an screenshot of the app:
